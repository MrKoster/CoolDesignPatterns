Design Patterns In C#

Hello
In this repository You will find design patterns implemented in C# demos,
mostly for educational purposes,
along with my commentary (in comments, in code, duh!).

Please feel free to read, copy, use, sell, basically You may do almost whatever You like with the code (MIT licence).
Also feel free to point out my mistakes, errors ect.

Current list of design patterns in the repo:
- Bridge
- Singleton (thread unsafe and thread safe)
- Adapter
- next ones comming soon...

Enjoy
